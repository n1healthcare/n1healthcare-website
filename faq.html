            <h3 class="question">What is the scope of services provided by N1 Healthcare Ltd.?</h3>
            <p class="ans">N1 Healthcare Ltd. specializes in offering comprehensive research and informational services
              in
              the realm of healthcare. Our primary focus is to equip our clients with in-depth health reports based on
              the

              conditions or prescribing medications. These are clinical activities that fall under the domain of
              licensed
              healthcare professionals. Therefore, we strongly advise our clients to consult with local clinics and
              hospitals in their country for any diagnosis or prescription needs. Our role is to provide you with
              information that you can discuss with your healthcare provider to make informed decisions about your
              health.

            <h3 class="question">What is the scope of services provided by N1 Healthcare Ltd.?</h3>
            <p class="ans">The name 'N1 Healthcare' is inspired by the concept of 'n-of-1 trials' in medicine. N-of-1
              trials are highly personalized clinical trials where a single patient forms the entire trial. This
              approach
              allows for the tailored assessment of how effective a specific treatment or intervention is for an
              individual, as opposed to a larger group. The benefits of n-of-1 trials include a deep focus on
              personalized
              medicine, where treatments are customized based on the individual's unique health profile, genetics, and
              specific responses to treatments. By adopting this philosophy, N1 Healthcare underscores its commitment to
              providing personalized healthcare insights and solutions, ensuring that our services are as individualized
              and relevant to each client as possible. We believe in the power of personalized healthcare to
              significantly
              improve health outcomes by focusing on the unique needs and conditions of each client.

          <div class="faq_box">
            <h3 class="question">How often should I update my health report with N1 Healthcare?</h3>
            <p class="ans">We recommend updating your health report periodically or whenever there are significant
              changes
              in your health or medical status. Regular updates ensure that the report accurately reflects your current
              health and includes the latest medical findings relevant to you.
